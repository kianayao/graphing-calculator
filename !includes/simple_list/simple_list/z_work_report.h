        -Implemented:
            n/a
        -Partly implemented:

    Bugs:
        My After and Before functions do not input the correct key.
        If I try to use Next at the end of a list, my program crashes.

    Reflections:
        I realize I said in my reflection for Polynomial that I would no
        longer procrastinate, howeer it happened again. I realize this
        sounds quite repetitive and likely annoying at this point, but I
        once again apologize. If after the spring break, I do not have my
        head on straight, then I am unsure of what I will do.I gave myself
        about three or so hours to work on this project and given two or three
        more I could have completed it. Unfortunately, I have once again fallen
        into the 20% chance that procrastination doesn't work. Again, I
        apologize, and excuse my French, but I will try harder to get my shit
        together because I want to succeed in your class and I know I am
        capable if I would only apply myself properly.

        Thank you,
            Kiana Yao
